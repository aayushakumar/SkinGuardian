## 🛠️ Installation

### **Option 1: Run from Source (Requires Python 3.9+)**
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Ensure your model file is in the correct directory**:
   - Place `beit_finetuned_model.onnx` in the same folder as `app.py`.

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Access the web interface**:
   - Open your browser and go to **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)**.

### **Option 2: Run as a Standalone EXE (No Python Needed)**
1. **Download** the pre-built EXE from `dist/app.exe` (or build it yourself using PyInstaller).
2. **Double-click** `app.exe` to start the application.
3. **On your browser open the app** at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
4. **Upload an image** and receive an AI-based analysis.

## 🏗️ How to Build an Executable (`.exe`) Using PyInstaller

If you want to package the app into a Windows executable:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. **Run the following command** to create a standalone EXE:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole app.py
   ```
3. **Find the EXE in the `dist/` folder**:
   - Run `dist/app.exe` to launch the application.
